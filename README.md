# Serials @ The Flea
## Voting App (Demo)

A demonstration of a voting app made for The Flea Theater.

Every "Serials @ The Flea" cycle, the audience is able to 
view the five newest plays. After they have viewed the plays
they are able to vote on their three favorite. These votes
are captured into a Google Sheets "database". This is made
possible with another script in Google Apps Scripts.
